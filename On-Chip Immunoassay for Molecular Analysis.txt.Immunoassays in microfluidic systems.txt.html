Chapter 9<br>On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis<br>Andy Ng<br>1 Introduction<br>1.1 Immunoassays<br>The specificity and affinity of antibody-antigen interactions has long been exploited in immunoassays for the detection of biomolecular analytes. In particular, immunoassays are used in a wide spectrum of applications in clinical diagnostics, molecular biology, proteomics and biosensing, for the measurement of many proteins and, to a lesser extent, small molecules due to their relatively smaller exposed surface for recognition. Immunoassays can be categorized into two main formats: homogeneous and heterogeneous assays. In homogeneous format, antibodies and antigens are in solution, and their interactions that lead to the formation of the antibody-antigen immunocomplex also occur in solution. On the other hand, in heterogeneous format, the antibodies or antigens <a name='31' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#31'><font color='#FF0000'>are immobilized on a solid support, and </font></a>their interactions take place at the boundary layer, and the unbound, or "non-captured" antibodies or antigens, as well as <a name='60' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#60'><font color='#FF0000'>other reagents can be easily removed. </font></a>Both immunoassay formats have been extensively studied and widely implemented in microfluidic platforms.<br><a name='2' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#2'><font color='#FF0000'>Immunoassays can be further </font><i><font color='#007F00'>classified </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>into competitive </font><i><font color='#007F00'>mode </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>and non-competitive modes.

As the amount of non-labeled antigen in a sample increases, the amount of labeled antigens that remain bound to the antibody decreases.

In non-competitive mode, there is an excess of antibodies. The antigen are first "captured", and subsequently detected by a second set of labeled antibodies, via recognition of a distinct recognition site (epitope) of the antigen. The formation of this antibody-antigen-antibody complex is described as <a name='77' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#77'><font color='#FF0000'>a "sandwich" immunoassay, </font><i><font color='#007F00'>where </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>the signal is proportional to the antigen concentration.<br></font></a>Conventional immunoassays, in particular <a name='27' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#27'><font color='#FF0000'>heterogeneous immunoassays, are performed in microtiter plates with 96 or more sample wells, </font></a>and typically involve a series of sample/reagent introduction, washing, mixing and incubation steps. The process often requires at least several hours and could last for up to days to perform a single experiment. The lengthy analysis time is mainly due to the long incubation step, attributed to the limitation in mass transport for all the reagents to migrate from within the solution to the antibody-coated surface, as the association rate of the antigen to the antibody is relatively rapid [1]. Robotic systems can be used to carry out repetitive fluid handling, thereby reducing hands-on time and improving the throughput, but require significant investment in infrastructure, as well as high maintenance efforts.<br>Miniaturization of the immunoassay within microfluidic systems represents an attractive solution to shortcomings and limitations in conventional immunoassays. Common microfluidic systems are built by networks of channels with dimensions in the m range. Fluids flow in a laminar manner at these scales, exhibiting neighbouring parallel fluidic streams where mixing occurs only through diffusion [2]. Due to the much smaller scale, mass transport is more efficient, and the increased surface to volume ratio further accelerates the antibody-antigen complex formation. The smaller dimensions of the channel significantly reduce the amount of reagent and sample required. Fluid handling are mostly automated through the design of channel networks, the use of valves and other features, thereby simplifying experimental procedures, improving reproducibility, reducing analysis time, increasing throughput and lowering the operating cost.<br><a name='81' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#81'><font color='#FF0000'>This </font><i><font color='#007F00'>chapter </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>focuses on </font><i><font color='#007F00'>a number </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>of </font><i><font color='#007F00'>main </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>developments in microfluidic immunoassays </font></a>in since 2000. Representative works are highlighted, presented and categorized in three areas: microfluidic immunoassay formats, fluid driving and handling technologies, and multiplexing approaches.<br>2 Immunoassay Formats in Microfluidic Systems<br>Both homogeneous and heterogeneous immunoassay formats (discussed above) have been developed into microfluidic-based assays. In homogeneous formats, analyte bound and free antibodies are both in solution, and can be distinguished by their mobility in the microfluidic channels; whereas in heterogeneous formats, all <a name='51' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#51'><font color='#FF0000'>antibodies are immobilized on the surface of the microfluidic device, or on beads </font><i><font color='#007F00'>introduced </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>in the device. </font></a>This section will discuss a number of microfluidic implementations in immunoassays based on electrophoresis-based homogeneous format, and surface- and bead-based heterogeneous formats.<br>9 On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis<br>2.1 Homogeneous Immunoassays in Microfluidic Systems<br>225<br>Homogeneous microfluidic immunoassays rely on the discrimination of analytebound and free antibodies for quantitative measurement. Formation of the immunocomplex creates differences between the analyte-bound and free antibodies in diffusion characteristics, [3] isoelectric point, [4] and electrophoretic mobilities. In particular, <a name='63' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#63'><font color='#FF0000'>gel electrophoresis </font><i><font color='#007F00'>separates </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>molecules based on electrophoretic mobility </font></a>due to differences molecular weight and conformation in the case of non-denaturing gel. Microfluidic immunoassays based on gel-electrophoresis that separate bound and unbound analytes have recently gained interests [5­7]. Under non-denaturing electrophoresis conditions, the immunocomplex remains intact in the gel matrix, usually made of polyacrylamide [8]. Since the reagents in homogeneous immunoassays, especially the antibody, are not immobilized and is free in the microfluidic channel, a concentration step is usually required to improve the detection sensitivity. Strategies such as the use of a preconcentration membrane to enrich the analyte have been employed. A microfluidic system integrating analyte preconcentration, reagent loading and discrimination of analyte-bound and non-bound antibody has been shown by Meagher et al. [6]. A protein analyte was first loaded into large pore-size polyacrylamide gel, which then migrated under an electric field onto a preconcentration membrane and trapped. A labeled antibody was then loaded and concentrated in the same area. Analyte-bound and non-bound antibodies were then separated in the separation channel containing polyacrylamide gel with small pore size that is suitable to discriminate the two antibody species. The assay can be carried out in less than 20 min with 10 L sample and achieved a detection limit of 10 pM for SEB detection and metalloproteinase-8 using saliva samples [9].<br>Isotachophoresis (ITP) is an electrokinetic method that has been applied in microfluidic chip as a separation and concentration technique in microchip-based electrophoresis that eliminates the use of a preconcentration membrane. ITP has been used as a promising sample pretreatment for a wide variety of analytes such as protein biomarkers, [10] and in a number of microfluidic-based immunoassays. In particular, ITP has been used to preconcentrate the immunocomplex before the electrophoretic separation step, resulting in enhanced sensitivity and reproducibility of the assay [7, 11]. An example is a microchip known as the "electrokinetic analyte transport assay" by Kawabata et al., [12] in which concentration, mixing and incubation of the reagents and analyte were integrated on-chip using ITP prior to electrophoretic separation, completing the entire analysis in about 2 min.<br>Due to its enhanced compatibility with electric force-based fluid manipulation and the rapid and straightforward separation, capillary electrophoresis (CE) has been used in microfluidic systems for carrying out immunoassays. Since the first report of CE-based microfluidic chip for detection of monoclonal antibodies and a small molecule drug, [13] the Harrison group has developed advanced CE-based microfluidic systems comprising of six independent channels for mixing, reaction, separation and detection within a single wafer. This CE-based chip can perform<br>226 A. Ng<br>simultaneous direct immunoassays for ovalbumin and anti-estradiol using fluorescence detection, completing the assay within 1 min [14]. CE-based chips have also been integrated with electrochemical measurement [15] for sensitive detection, as well as high throughput immunoassays in competitive mode [16]. In addition, CE-based chip can be adapted for continuous flow, replacing used reagents and buffer with fresh ones, thereby prolonging CE to 24 h for monitoring insulin secretion from islet [17, 18].<br>2.2 Heterogeneous Immunoassays in Microfluidic Systems<br>In heterogeneous immunoassays, antibodies are immobilized on the surface of a solid support. In general, the solid support can either be the surface of the microfluidic device or on beads typically of m-dimension that are embedded in the channel or chamber within the device. Whereas antibody immobilization is a key step because it can dramatically influences the specificity and sensitivity of the assay, <a name='57' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#57'><font color='#FF0000'>strategies for analyte delivery and washing can </font><i><font color='#007F00'>also affect </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>the </font></a>performance of the assay in terms of analysis time and limit of detection.<br>2.2.1 Antibody Immobilization<br>Microfluidic substrates are commonly made from materials including glass, silicon, silicon nitride [19], polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)[20, 21], polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) [22] and polystyrene [23]. The simplest method to immobilize antibody onto a microfluidic substrate is by physical adsorption. While being extremely simple, this method often results in significant reduction in antibody activity due to steric hindrance, random and unfavourable orientation and denaturation of the antibody [24]. Due to these shortcomings, more controlled and specific immobilization strategies by bioaffinity and covalent immobilization have been developed.<br>One strategy is the use of a long covalent linker to "tether" the antibody, which keeps the antibody a defined distance away from the surface, thereby maintaining a chemical environment around the antibody similar to the bulk solution, minimizing <a name='50' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#50'><font color='#FF0000'>problems associated with accessibility and steric </font></a>effects. Indeed, <a name='54' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#54'><font color='#FF0000'>different strategies for covalent </font><i><font color='#007F00'>immobilization </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>of antibodies </font></a>on silicon substrates have been compared by Yakovleva et al., [25, 26] demonstrating that <a name='26' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#26'><font color='#FF0000'>long </font><i><font color='#007F00'>and </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>flexible linkers such as polyethyleneimine (PEI) </font><i><font color='#007F00'>[27] </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>and dextran </font></a>[28] led to <a name='34' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#34'><font color='#FF0000'>more favourable </font><i><font color='#007F00'>immunoreaction </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>than </font><i><font color='#007F00'>short </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>linkers such as 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). </font></a>Antibody functionality can also be maximized by the use of bioaffinity interactions. <a name='32' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#32'><font color='#FF0000'>A novel antibody immobilization </font><i><font color='#007F00'>strategy </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>on PMMA surface </font></a>was reported by Wen et al., [29] who used a surface linker biotin-poly(L-lysine)graft-poly(ethylene glycol) (biotin-PLL-g-PEG) for immobilization. <a name='30' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#30'><font color='#FF0000'>The PMMA was activated by plasma, </font></a>followed by coating with poly(acrylic acid) to add<br>9 On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis<br>227<br>functional carboxyl groups, which form electrostatic interactions with biotin-PLLg-PEG. NeutrAvidin labeled-Protein A binds strongly to the biotin, effectively linking Protein A to the surface, which captured antibody in an orientation-specific manner via the Fc region of the antibody. In addition, the PEG moiety on the PMMA surface helped reduce non-specific adsorption. <a name='36' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#36'><font color='#FF0000'>This strategy resulted in </font><i><font color='#007F00'>a </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>higher </font><i><font color='#007F00'>analyte </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>capture efficiency than </font></a>direct covalent linkage of Protein to PMMA.<br>Antibody can also be directly entrapped in the microfluidic substrate material during the fabrication step. Heyries et al. [30] spotted antibody solution on a Teflon mould by a microarrayer, followed by pouring liquid PDMS. After curing, the PDMS was peeled off and the antibody molecules were thereby transferred to the PDMS. The transferred antibody showed efficient analyte capture with the overall assay sensitivity at ng/mL sensitivity.<br>2.2.2 Analyte Transport and Delivery<br>Compared to conventional microtitre wells format, microfluidic systems offer more efficient mass transport due to the significantly reduced diffusion distances inside microchannels/microchambers, thus rapid analyses can be performed at small sample volumes. However, at low analyte concentrations, the transport of analyte can still be limited [31]. While there has been significant effort focused on a reduction of the size of the sensing region, [32] there is less attention on the improvement of the design of microfluidic elements. Transport can be enhanced by further lower the dimensions of the microfluidic features, but there is obviously a limit at which the devices can be miniaturized before the resistance to fluidic flow becomes impractical to handle. Because diffusion is the only method for transporting the analyte to the immobilized capture antibody, and that <a name='56' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#56'><font color='#FF0000'>the </font><i><font color='#007F00'>replenishment </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>of </font><i><font color='#007F00'>the </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>analyte at the boundary layer </font></a>on the capture surface is subject to mass transport limitations, [33, 34] one way to improve analyte delivery to the <a name='43' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#43'><font color='#FF0000'>capture </font><i><font color='#007F00'>antibody </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>is to integrate mixing </font><i><font color='#007F00'>functionalities </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>in the microfluidic </font></a>system. Periodically pulsing the analyte solution in simple "forward-backward" flow within serpentine channels led to higher analyte capture [35]. Passive mixers built with micro-dimensioned features such as patterned grooves/herringbone ridges patterned in the top of the microchannel have been shown to increase the sensitivity of immunoassay by more than 26 % [36, 37]. The grooves in the channel induced mixing of the fluid, thereby encouraging the <a name='42' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#42'><font color='#FF0000'>delivery of analyte to the capture </font></a>region, as well as continuously replenishing analyte molecules at the boundary layer, preventing analyte depletion. An active mixing strategy developed by Jennisen and Zumbrink [38] used a bubble introduced into the channel upstream of the analyte solution, which moved over the sensing surface through the solution, creating a vortex sheet between the fluid layer close to the surface and the bulk solution that achieve good analyte transport to the sensor via effective mixing. Another strategy to create enhanced transport of the analyte to the capture surface has been developed by Hofmann et al. [39] The rapid delivery of analyte to capture antibodies in small volume sample was achieved by a flow confinement method, in<br>228 A.

The magnetic chain was formed by trapping magnetic beads in microchannels with cross-sections with periodically enlarged size. <a name='25' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#25'><font color='#FF0000'>When a </font><i><font color='#007F00'>magnetic </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>field is applied, the </font></a><a name='55' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#55'><font color='#FF0000'>magnetic beads self-assembled </font><i><font color='#007F00'>as </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>chains along the </font></a>length of the channel. This mechanism provided efficient mixing and as a result enhanced the antigen capture in an immunoassay performed completely on-chip with detection limit in the range of a few ng/mL in 30 min, using only nL of reagents and antibody solution.<br>2.3.2 Non-magnetic Microbeads<br>Non-magnetic microbeads require physical retention for manipulation, and the removal of unbound analyte. Physical retention of non-magnetic microbeads can be achieved by microstructures fabricated within the microfluidic system. The Kitamori group used a dam structure to trap antibody-coated polystyrene beads [47, 48]. Ko et al. [49] developed an integrated chip for protein sensing using antibody-coated polystyrene beads trapped in a reaction area by micropillars made of PDMS. Sample solution, gold nanoparticles labeling agent, and signal generation solution were then flow through the trapped beads. The gold nanoparticles catalyzed the silver ions in the signal generation solution into metallic silver, which in turn deposited onto the gold nanoparticles and thereby enlarged the particles to 100 nm. The enlarged particles formed an electrical bridge between the electrodes layered on the sensing surface, resulting in a signal due to the decrease in resistance. The entire chip-based assay can be completed in less than an hour, while performing the same assay with a conventional setup requires at least several hours on hands on time.<br>Employing a configuration similar to solid-phase extraction, Shin et al. [50] packed antibody-conjugated microbeads against a frit structure as a <a name='61' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#61'><font color='#FF0000'>strategy to increase the sensitivity of </font></a>immunoassay for C-reactive protein (CRP). Captured CRP were captured in the packed bead matrix, and subsequently eluted in an acidic buffer. The extraction also worked successfully to detect CRP in complex sample such as serum and cerebrospinal fluid [51].<br>Non-magnetic <a name='62' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#62'><font color='#FF0000'>microbeads can </font><i><font color='#007F00'>also </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>be immobilized by dielectrophoresis </font><i><font color='#007F00'>[52] </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>or electrostatic forces </font></a>[53, 54] without the use of microstructures for physical retention of the beads. Holmes et al. [52] developed a microchip-based flow cytometer using commercial methacrylate beads for capture antibody immobilization. The microchip-based flow cytometer used negative dielectrophoresis <a name='80' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#80'><font color='#FF0000'>to focus the </font><i><font color='#007F00'>microbeads </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>into a stream </font></a>of particle, and the impedance and fluorescence signals of each bead were measured.<br>In the work by Sivagananam, [53] positively charged APTES were patterned on a glass substrate, and negatively charged streptavidin-coated microbeads were assembled electrostatically. The assembled beads were then used for conjugation<br>230 A. Ng<br>with the capture antibody. Using mouse IgG as a model analyte, this method reached a detection limit of 250 pg/mL when operating in continuous-flow mode.<br>The majority of microbead-based strategies only employed the outer surface of the beads for antibody immobilization. Unique implementation of the bead-based immunoassay such as the work by Yang et al., [55] in which superporous agarose beads with diameters ranging from 10 to 80 m were used as a solid support. <a name='44' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#44'><font color='#FF0000'>The </font><i><font color='#007F00'>superporous agarose </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>beads were covalently conjugated to Protein A, which </font><i><font color='#007F00'>immobilize </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>the capture antibody in a favourable orientation. </font></a>Using these superporous beads as immobilization materials, the immunoassay detected goat IgG, as a model analyte, with a detection limit of 100 pg/mL, a 10 times improvement over conventional bead-based microfluidic assays. The large surface area attributed to the inner matrix of the agarose beads, as well as the lowered fluidic resistance due to the porosity of the beads have led to the enhanced sensitivity of the assay.<br>3 Fluid Driving and Handling Technologies in Microfluidic Systems<br>Fluid transport plays an integral role in microfluidic immunoassays, and the performance of the fluid driving and handling system directly affect the result of the assays. To miniaturize the fluidic operations analogous to the steps in conventional immunoassays, [56] many strategies for on-chip liquid transport have been reported. The force for fluidic transport modalities can be categorized into electric, pressure and power-free passive forces.<br>3.1 Electric Forces<br><a name='10' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#10'><font color='#FF0000'>Electric forces for </font><i><font color='#007F00'>fluid </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>flow are generated by </font></a>electroosmotic pumping based on electroosmotic flow (EOF).

Using this mechanism, fluid handling such as flow initiation, stopping and direction can be easily controlled by the applied electric field, and do not require valves or pumps. Furthermore, controlling fluid flow by electric field alone facilitates automation.<br>The first application of electric force-driven fluid flow in immunoassays was by Rooij et al. [58, 59] and further developed by Gao et al. [60, 61]. For example, Gao et al. developed a microfluidic chip for detection of multiple microbial antigens based on electroosmotic pumping [60]. The microchip first used a microfluidic<br>9 On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis<br>231<br>network to adsorb the analyte onto a PDMS-coated glass slide. Another PDMS bearing H-shaped microchannels for reagent delivery was then bonded to the slide. The sequential delivery of reagent solutions was performed automatically by a programmable voltage sequencer. This method was able to detect bacterial lysate antigen and achieved a detection limit of 3 g/mL. Simultaneous detection of human antibodies against two bacterial species in serum was also possible with this automatic system [61].<br>Electric force-driven immunoassay could <a name='35' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#35'><font color='#FF0000'>have better </font><i><font color='#007F00'>binding </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>kinetics than pressure-driven assays. </font></a>Hu et al. [62] built a two-dimensional computation model to simulate the mass transport and binding between the antigen in the bulk fluid flow and the immobilized antibody on the surface of the microchannel. The model showed that, due to the uniform, plug-like fluid flow profile as a result of electroosmosis, assays using electric force-driven flow indeed exhibited superior reaction kinetics than pressure-driven ones. However, there are strict design constraints for the construction of electric force-based system. <a name='72' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#72'><font color='#FF0000'>The substrate material should be non-conductive, </font><i><font color='#007F00'>other </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>electrical breakdown </font></a>or short circuit might occur. Furthermore, the choice of buffer and reagents <a name='29' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#29'><font color='#FF0000'>used in such systems must be conductive. </font></a>Although most buffers in biochemical assays contain salts and therefore conductive, an ionic strength that is too high might cause Joule heating, which significantly affects the conformation of biomolecules and hence antibody-antigen recognition, as well as causing denaturing and aggregation of other biomolecules present in the sample matrix, particularly in complex <a name='33' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#33'><font color='#FF0000'>biological </font><i><font color='#007F00'>samples </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>such as blood and urine.<br></font></a>Another electric force-based fluid transport strategy is electrowetting, whereby liquid, <a name='1' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#1'><font color='#FF0000'>in contrast to continuous flow in channels, </font></a>are handled as discrete droplets, in the presence of voltage sequences applied to an electrode array <a name='78' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#78'><font color='#FF0000'>insulated by a hydrophobic dielectric layer </font></a>[63]. Electrowetting is often combined with magnetic microbead-based immunoassays for liquid droplet manipulations, separation of bound and unbound analyte and washing steps. Sista et al. [43] developed a microchip containing a sample droplet and a reagent droplet containing capture antibody-conjugated magnetic microbeads and detection antibody. Electrowettingbased manipulation moved and merged the two droplets, and after an incubation of 2 min the droplet containing the sandwich immunocomplex on microbead was delivered over a magnet, followed by capture by the magnetic field.

Copyright © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008<br>3.2 Pressure-Driven Fluid Handling Modalities<br>The most popular fluid handling modality for microfluidic immunoassay is by pressure-driven flow. In contrast to electric-force driven flow, pressure-driven modalities do not have strict requirement on the conductivity of the solution and substrates, and therefore are <a name='49' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#49'><font color='#FF0000'>compatible with a range of </font><i><font color='#007F00'>samples, reagents </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>and </font></a>device materials. On the other hand, pressure-drive flow exhibits a less uniform, parabolic flow profile, which results in the dispersion of the liquid plug, and therefore is considered less useful for separations [64].<br>The <a name='11' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#11'><font color='#FF0000'>simplest </font><i><font color='#007F00'>setup for </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>pressure-driven flow can be created </font></a><a name='52' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#52'><font color='#FF0000'>by </font><i><font color='#007F00'>leaving the </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>inlet </font><i><font color='#007F00'>open </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>to atmospheric pressure and applying vacuum at the outlet </font></a>using a vacuum pump, similar to a sucking action. The fluid can also be pushed <a name='74' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#74'><font color='#FF0000'>by applying </font><i><font color='#007F00'>a </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>positive pressure at the inlet and </font><i><font color='#007F00'>leaving </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>the outlet to atmospheric pressure. </font></a>In low-cost microfluidic chip designs, actuation by applying pressure using the hand or thumb have been demonstrated [65, 66].<br>9 On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis<br>233<br>For more precise control of pressure-driven flow and automation, micropneumatic pumps integrated with the microfluidic chip have been developed and have become popular for immunoassays. The micropneumatic pump is composed of a fluid flow in a microchannel, mechanically flexible membranes such as those made of PDMS and air chambers or valves that pneumatically deflect the PDMS membranes by introduction of compressed air [44, 67, 68]. Liquid is propelled by the peristaltic action driven by the time-phased deflection of PDMS membranes above the fluid flow along the microchannel, and is particularly suitable for sequential liquid delivery. Detection of host-generated antibody against infection pathogens has been demonstrated with micropnuematic pumps in microfluidic immunoassays [67]. In this system, <a name='67' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#67'><font color='#FF0000'>a </font><i><font color='#007F00'>capture probe </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>was </font><i><font color='#007F00'>first adsorbed </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>on the surface of the detection </font></a>zone. Serum sample, washing buffer, detection antibody and signal generation reagents stored in separate reservoirs were sequentially delivered to the detection zone by the micropneumatic pump. The signal generated was then detected optically by absorbance measurement. The peristaltic action required at least three pneumatic valves for controlled sequential deflection of the PDMS membranes [69].<br>In a more recent design by Schudel et al. [70], the valve structure utilized flexible PDMS membranes with microfabricated barrier features or gates that are lifted away from a substrate by vacuum, thus allowing the fluid to flow. Kim et al. [71] used these lifting gate microvalves and built pumping capabilities within microfluidics. The pump consisted of a linear array of three microvalves in series with cyclic actuation, and was capable of efficient and automated fluid transport. The lifting gate structures offer enhanced and direct integration with patterned solid substrates.<br>To simplify design and control algorithms, it is desirable to limit the number of pneumatic valves required for pumping. For this, alternative designs for micropneumatic pumps that used air chambers of different sizes interconnected by air channels were developed [72, 73]. Using interconnected air chambers caused the membranes to deflect at different times, allowed for their sequential actuation and introduced the latency required to generate peristaltic pumping action on the PDMS membranes, but only one pneumatic valve was required. This micropneumatic pump was used in bead-based immunoassays with flow cytometry detection [44]. The transport of samples, washing buffer, antibody-conjugated magnetic beads, detection antibody and sheath flow for focusing the sample stream were all provided by the micropneumatic pump, and the entire process including sample incubation and final detection step took 40 min.<br>3.3 Centrifugal Force-Driven Modalities<br>Centrifugal force-based microfluidic platforms have been developed and typically built from round substrate similar to the compact disc (CD) form factor and footprint. CD-based microfluidic systems contain networks of channels and<br>234 A. Ng<br>chambers that perform many analytical functions, including sample/reagent transport, dilution, mixing and separation, all within a disc format.<br>The main characteristic of microfluidic systems on a CD is the use of centrifugal force controlled by the rotation speed of the CD. The centrifugal force is to overcome the capillary or surface force which prevents the liquid contained in one chamber from exiting. As the centrifugal force increases from the center towards the outer edge of the CD, sequential pumping of liquid can be achieved. Similar to all pressure-driven flow methods, centrifugal force-driven flow is not affected by the physiochemical properties of the fluid. In addition, because of the CD format, these devices can be easily adapted with optical detectors similar to the mechanism of a CD player.<br>Centrifugal force-driven microfluidics have attracted attentions and have been implemented for carrying out homogeneous immunoassays for pathogen antigen detection [74]. A number of commercial assays have also been developed. Gyrolab used a packed bed of microbeads and performed multiple reagent delivery steps controlled by centrifugal forces to perform immunoassays [75]. The bed of microbeads formed an assay surface on which reagents flow through for analyte capture and washing, followed by optical detection using a laser directly on the device.<br>The ability of centrifugal-based microfluidic <a name='68' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#68'><font color='#FF0000'>to implement </font><i><font color='#007F00'>on-chip </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>blood separation is particularly attractive. </font></a>Lee et al.

This platform first mixed a whole blood sample with capture antibodyconjugated microbeads and fluorescently-labeled detection antibody. Binding of the analyte between the capture and detection antibody formed a sandwich and fluorescent immunocomplex. Subsequently, the centrifugal device separated the beads with the immunocomplex from the blood sample through a density media, which effectively washes the beads and remove all interfering agents. As the bead pellet at the end of the channel located at the out edge of the disk, fluorescent signal can be measured and the analyte quantified (Fig. 9.3).<br>9 On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis<br>235<br>Fig. 9.3 Concept of a centrifugal microfluidic platform incorporating sedimentation-based immunoassay for analyte detection from whole blood sample.

However, the system was unable to sequentially deliver multiple reagents required to amplify the signals and enhance the detection limit of the assay.<br>Safavieh and Juncker [83] introduced two novel capillary elements: trigger valve and retention burst valve. A trigger valve consists of a shallow channel, intersecting another channel that is deeper, covered by a hydrophobic layer. The abrupt increase in the cross-section of the microchannel making it energetically unfavourable for the liquid to flow from the shallow to the deep channel due to the large increase in liquid-air interface at the liquid front. The trigger valve is triggered by flowing a liquid through the larger channel. A retention burst valve is formed by constrictions in the microchannel that produce high capillary pressure. When the pressure in the capillary circuit near the retention burst valve is weaker that the valve's burst pressure, liquid remains pinned by the retention burst valve. When the pressure in the circuit builds up and rise above the valve's burst pressure, the liquid begins draining the channel of the valve until it eventually bursts, and as a result the reservoir downstream of the retention burst valve beings to drain rapidly (Fig. 9.4).<br>A novel capillary circuit was built by combining a variety of capillary elements, and achieved completely autonomous delivery of multiple liquid reagents according to a defined sequence that followed a preprogrammed and predetermined flow rate and timing. The capillary circuit was able to perform a sandwich immunoassay to measure the concentration of C-reactive protein. The authors defined such circuit as capillarics and introduced symbolic representations reminiscent of those used in electrical circuits.<br>Fig. 9.4 Optical micrograph of a microfluidic capillaric circuit containing 4 side-reservoirs made in PDMS.

A well-known method developed by Delamarche [91] used microfluidic networks (FN) to pattern antibody on surfaces.

In this system, magnetic actuation was used to transfer the beads into and out of incubation and washing solutions, which defined the incubation time and also allowed continuous flow operation to perform continuous concentration monitoring. The binding kinetics of the assay was empirically characterized to determine the optimal incubation times, achieving sensitivities in the range 1 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL for detection of IL-6 and TNF-, respectively.<br>Another innovative use of microbeads for multiplex immunoassays is the use of DNA for barcoding [41, 99, 100]. In this method, a sandwich immunoassay was carried out on microbeads, where <a name='5' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#5'><font color='#FF0000'>the detection antibody </font><i><font color='#007F00'>was labeled </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>with gold nanoparticles </font><i><font color='#007F00'>that were </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>also conjugated with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) </font><i><font color='#007F00'>barcodes. </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>After the </font></a>sandwich immunocomplex was formed at the end of the <a name='64' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#64'><font color='#FF0000'>immunoassay, the dsDNA is denatured, and the </font></a>dissociated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was detected by either DNA assay, PCR amplification to reach aM sensitivity or DNA microarray for multiplex detection.

Antibody-analyte interaction is accelerated due to enhanced transport within microfluidics, resulting in more rapid analysis and<br>240 A. Ng<br>improved sensitivity in comparison to conventional methods. Analysis of complex biological samples such as blood is possible with microfluidics, and is best handled by pressure-driven flow due to the more stringent requirement of electric forcebased and capillary-driven systems on the composition and viscosity of the sample. On the other hand, more complex capillary circuits with novel elements have been demonstrated, allowing for precisely controlled sequence of fluid operation performed in full automation with minimal requirement for instrumentation and power. Bead-based heterogeneous assays have experienced significant progress, particularly in the development of novel encoded beads for multiplexing.<br>Whereas microfluidic immunoassays progress significantly in the last decades, the potential for more advancement remains very high. In particular, multiple fluid handling modalities would be applied in synergy and integrated within a single platform, hence more complex fluid operation can be carried out with enhanced precision and reliability. Integration of novel transducers and detection methods with microfluidic would further improve the specificity and sensitivity of the assay, and facilitate multiplexing.<br>There are still challenges to be overcome. New strategies for reagents pre-loading and their long-term storage on-chip need to be developed. The issue of reagent stability is particularly important for immunoassays as most biological reagents, such as antibodies, are perishable and require specific storage environments. Whereas polymeric substrates such as PDMS are the preferred materials for prototype fabrication at the laboratory level, materials with similar properties but having capabilities for mass production such as injection molding are in great demand for practical applications and commercialization. The ultimate goal of microfluidic system development is to provide fully integrated, packaged, robust, user-friendly, low-cost and disposable devices. Given the active research and continual progress in the field, and the increasing number of innovations, it is envisioned that this goal can be achieved in the near future.
