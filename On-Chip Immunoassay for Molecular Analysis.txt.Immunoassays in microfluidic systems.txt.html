The process often requires at least several hours and could last for up to days to perform a single experiment. The lengthy analysis time is mainly due to the long incubation step, attributed to the limitation in mass transport for all the reagents to migrate from within the solution <a name='112' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#112'><font color='#FF0000'>to the </font><i><font color='#007F00'>antibody-coated </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>surface, </font><i><font color='#007F00'>as </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>the </font><i><font color='#007F00'>association rate </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>of </font><i><font color='#007F00'>the antigen to </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>the </font></a>antibody is relatively rapid [1].

Common microfluidic systems are built by networks of channels with dimensions in the m range. Fluids flow in a laminar manner at these scales, exhibiting neighbouring parallel fluidic streams where mixing occurs only through diffusion [2]. Due to the much smaller scale, mass transport is more efficient, and the increased surface to volume ratio further accelerates the antibody-antigen complex formation. The smaller dimensions of the channel significantly reduce the amount of reagent and sample required. Fluid handling are mostly automated through the design of channel networks, the use of valves and other features, thereby simplifying experimental procedures, improving reproducibility, reducing analysis time, increasing throughput and lowering the operating cost.<br>This chapter focuses on a number of main <a name='5' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#5'><font color='#FF0000'>developments in </font><i><font color='#007F00'>microfluidic </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>immunoassays </font><i><font color='#007F00'>in </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>since 2000. </font></a>Representative works are highlighted, presented and categorized <a name='100' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#100'><font color='#FF0000'>in </font><i><font color='#007F00'>three </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>areas: microfluidic immunoassay </font><i><font color='#007F00'>formats, </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>fluid </font></a>driving and handling technologies, and multiplexing approaches.<br>2 Immunoassay Formats in Microfluidic Systems<br>Both homogeneous and heterogeneous immunoassay formats (discussed above) have been developed into microfluidic-based assays. <a name='1' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#1'><font color='#FF0000'>In homogeneous </font><i><font color='#007F00'>formats, analyte </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>bound and </font><i><font color='#007F00'>free </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>antibodies are </font></a>both in solution, and can be distinguished by their mobility in the microfluidic channels; whereas <a name='85' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#85'><font color='#FF0000'>in heterogeneous </font><i><font color='#007F00'>formats, all </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>antibodies are immobilized on the surface of the microfluidic device, or on beads </font><i><font color='#007F00'>introduced </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>in the device. </font></a>This section will discuss a number of microfluidic implementations in immunoassays based on electrophoresis-based homogeneous format, and surface- and bead-based heterogeneous formats.<br>9 On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis<br>2.1 Homogeneous <a name='130' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#130'><font color='#FF0000'>Immunoassays in Microfluidic Systems<br></font><i><font color='#007F00'>225<br>Homogeneous </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>microfluidic </font></a>immunoassays rely on the discrimination of analytebound and free antibodies for quantitative measurement.

Microfluidic immunoassays based on gel-electrophoresis that separate bound and unbound analytes have recently gained interests [5­7]. Under non-denaturing electrophoresis conditions, the immunocomplex remains intact in the gel matrix, usually made of polyacrylamide [8]. Since the reagents in homogeneous immunoassays, especially the antibody, are not immobilized and is free in the microfluidic channel, a concentration step is usually required to improve the detection sensitivity. Strategies such as the use of a preconcentration membrane to enrich the analyte have been employed. A microfluidic system integrating analyte preconcentration, reagent loading and discrimination of analyte-bound and non-bound antibody <a name='14' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#14'><font color='#FF0000'>has been </font><i><font color='#007F00'>shown </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>by </font><i><font color='#007F00'>Meagher </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>et al. </font></a>[6]. A protein analyte was first loaded into large pore-size polyacrylamide gel, which then migrated under an electric field onto a preconcentration membrane and trapped. A labeled antibody was then loaded and concentrated in the same area. Analyte-bound and non-bound antibodies were then separated in the separation channel containing polyacrylamide gel with small pore size that is suitable to discriminate the two antibody species. The assay can be carried out in less than 20 min with 10 L sample and achieved a detection limit of 10 pM for SEB detection and metalloproteinase-8 using saliva samples [9].<br>Isotachophoresis (ITP) is an electrokinetic method that has been applied in microfluidic chip as a separation and concentration technique in microchip-based electrophoresis that eliminates the use of a preconcentration membrane. ITP <a name='20' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#20'><font color='#FF0000'>has been used as a </font><i><font color='#007F00'>promising sample pretreatment </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>for </font></a>a wide variety of analytes such as protein biomarkers, [10] and in a number of microfluidic-based immunoassays. In particular, ITP has been used to preconcentrate the immunocomplex before the electrophoretic separation step, resulting in enhanced sensitivity and reproducibility of the assay [7, 11]. An example is a microchip known as the "electrokinetic analyte transport assay" <a name='152' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#152'><font color='#FF0000'>by </font><i><font color='#007F00'>Kawabata </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>et al., </font><i><font color='#007F00'>[12] </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>in which </font></a>concentration, mixing and incubation of the reagents and analyte were integrated on-chip using ITP prior to electrophoretic separation, completing the entire analysis in about 2 min.<br>Due to its enhanced <a name='151' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#151'><font color='#FF0000'>compatibility with </font><i><font color='#007F00'>electric force-based </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>fluid manipulation </font><i><font color='#007F00'>and the rapid </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>and </font></a>straightforward separation, capillary electrophoresis (CE) has <a name='19' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#19'><font color='#FF0000'>been used in microfluidic systems </font></a>for carrying out immunoassays.

CE-based chips have also been integrated with electrochemical measurement [15] for sensitive detection, as well as high throughput immunoassays in competitive mode [16]. In addition, CE-based chip can be adapted for continuous flow, replacing used reagents and buffer with fresh ones, thereby prolonging CE to 24 h for <a name='38' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#38'><font color='#FF0000'>monitoring insulin secretion from islet </font></a>[17, 18].<br>2.2 Heterogeneous Immunoassays in Microfluidic Systems<br>In heterogeneous immunoassays, antibodies <a name='104' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#104'><font color='#FF0000'>are immobilized on the surface of </font><i><font color='#007F00'>a solid support. </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>In </font><i><font color='#007F00'>general, </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>the </font></a>solid support can either be <a name='149' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#149'><font color='#FF0000'>the </font><i><font color='#007F00'>surface </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>of the microfluidic device </font></a>or on beads typically of m-dimension that are embedded in the channel or chamber within the device.

The simplest method to immobilize antibody onto a microfluidic substrate is by physical adsorption. While being extremely simple, this method often results in significant reduction in antibody activity due to steric hindrance, random and unfavourable orientation and denaturation of the antibody [24]. Due to these shortcomings, more controlled and specific immobilization strategies by bioaffinity <a name='16' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#16'><font color='#FF0000'>and </font><i><font color='#007F00'>covalent </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>immobilization have been developed.<br></font></a>One strategy is the use of a long covalent linker to "tether" the antibody, which keeps the antibody a defined distance away from the surface, thereby maintaining a chemical environment around the antibody similar to the bulk solution, minimizing <a name='83' href='Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.html#83'><font color='#FF0000'>problems associated with accessibility and steric </font><i><font color='#007F00'>effects.

Heyries et al. [30] spotted antibody solution on a Teflon mould by a microarrayer, followed by pouring liquid PDMS.

The transferred antibody showed efficient analyte capture with the overall assay sensitivity at ng/mL sensitivity.<br>2.2.2 Analyte Transport and Delivery<br>Compared to conventional microtitre wells format, microfluidic systems offer more efficient mass transport due to the significantly reduced diffusion distances inside microchannels/microchambers, thus rapid analyses can be performed at small sample volumes. However, at low analyte concentrations, the transport of analyte can still be limited [31].

An active mixing strategy developed by Jennisen and Zumbrink [38] used a bubble introduced into the channel upstream of the analyte solution, which moved over the sensing surface through the solution, creating a vortex sheet between the fluid layer close to the surface and the bulk solution that achieve good analyte transport to the sensor via effective mixing.

The pump consisted of a linear array of three microvalves in series with cyclic actuation, and was capable of efficient and automated fluid transport. The lifting gate structures offer enhanced and direct integration with patterned solid substrates.<br>To simplify design and control algorithms, it is desirable to limit the number of pneumatic valves required for pumping. For this, alternative designs for micropneumatic pumps that used air chambers of different sizes interconnected by air channels were developed [72, 73]. Using interconnected air chambers caused the membranes to deflect at different times, allowed for their sequential actuation and introduced the latency required to generate peristaltic pumping action on the PDMS membranes, but only one pneumatic valve was required. This micropneumatic pump was used in bead-based immunoassays with flow cytometry detection [44]. The transport of samples, washing buffer, antibody-conjugated magnetic beads, detection antibody and sheath flow for focusing the sample stream were all provided by the micropneumatic pump, and the entire process including sample incubation and final detection step took 40 min.<br>3.3 Centrifugal Force-Driven Modalities<br>Centrifugal force-based microfluidic platforms have been developed and typically built from round substrate similar to the compact disc (CD) form factor and footprint.

Ng<br>chambers that perform many analytical functions, including sample/reagent transport, dilution, mixing and separation, all within a disc format.<br>The main characteristic of microfluidic systems on a CD is the use of centrifugal force controlled by the rotation speed of the CD. The centrifugal force is to overcome the capillary or surface force which prevents the liquid contained in one chamber from exiting.

However, the system was unable to sequentially deliver multiple reagents required to amplify the signals and enhance the detection limit of the assay.<br>Safavieh and Juncker [83] introduced two novel capillary elements: trigger valve and retention burst valve. A trigger valve consists of a shallow channel, intersecting another channel that is deeper, covered by a hydrophobic layer. The abrupt increase in the cross-section of the microchannel making it energetically unfavourable for the liquid to flow from the shallow to the deep channel due to the large increase in liquid-air interface at the liquid front. The trigger valve is triggered by flowing a liquid through the larger channel. A retention burst valve is formed by constrictions in the microchannel that produce high capillary pressure. When the pressure in the capillary circuit near the retention burst valve is weaker that the valve's burst pressure, liquid remains pinned by the retention burst valve. When the pressure in the circuit builds up and rise above the valve's burst pressure, the liquid begins draining the channel of the valve until it eventually bursts, and as a result the reservoir downstream of the retention burst valve beings to drain rapidly (Fig. 9.4).<br>A novel capillary circuit was built by combining a variety of capillary elements, and achieved completely autonomous delivery of multiple liquid reagents according to a defined sequence that followed a preprogrammed and predetermined flow rate and timing.

On the other hand, more complex capillary circuits with novel elements have been demonstrated, allowing for precisely controlled sequence of fluid operation performed in full automation with minimal requirement for instrumentation and power. Bead-based heterogeneous assays have experienced significant progress, particularly in the development of novel encoded beads for multiplexing.<br>Whereas microfluidic immunoassays progress significantly in the last decades, the potential for more advancement remains very high. In particular, multiple fluid handling modalities would be applied in synergy and integrated within a single platform, hence more complex fluid operation can be carried out with enhanced precision and reliability. Integration of novel transducers and detection methods with microfluidic would further improve the specificity and sensitivity of the assay, and facilitate multiplexing.<br>There are still challenges to be overcome. New strategies for reagents pre-loading and their long-term storage on-chip need to be developed. The issue of reagent stability is particularly important for immunoassays as most biological reagents, such as antibodies, are perishable and require specific storage environments. Whereas polymeric substrates such as PDMS are the preferred materials for prototype fabrication at the laboratory level, materials with similar properties but having capabilities for mass production such as injection molding are in great demand for practical applications and commercialization. The ultimate goal of microfluidic system development is to provide fully integrated, packaged, robust, user-friendly, low-cost and disposable devices. Given the active research and continual progress in the field, and the increasing number of innovations, it is envisioned that this goal can be achieved in the near future.
