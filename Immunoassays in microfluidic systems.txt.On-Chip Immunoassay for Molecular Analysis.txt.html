Ng et al.<br>steps: (1) sample preparation, (2) antibody and analyte delivery, (3) mixing and incubation (4) washing unbound antibodies, (5) substrate delivery and (6) detection. Incubation time can require several hours because analyte molecules must diffuse across long distances before they encounter antibodies on the surface. To improve throughput of these processes, robotic systems can be used for fluid handling, but this solution is only available to wealthy laboratories, and requires significant maintenance efforts and a large laboratory footprint.<br>One way of circumventing problems associated with conventional immunoassays is miniaturization in microfluidic systems. The most common microfluidic paradigm relies on networks of enclosed micron-dimension channels. At these small scales, fluids exhibit laminar flow, i.e. fluidic streams that flow parallel to each other, and mixing occurs only by diffusion [5]. Microfluidic immunoassays offer at least three advantages over conventional methods [4]: (1) increased surface area to volume ratios speeds up antibody­antigen reactions; (2) smaller dimensions reduce the consumption of expensive reagents and precious samples; and (3) automated fluid handling can improve reproducibility and throughput. These advantages can potentially improve the performance and reduce the operating cost of conventional immunoassays.<br>This review focuses on some of the major developments in microfluidic immunoassays between the years 2000 to 2010. Reviewing the field in its entirety would be challenging; here, we highlight unique contributions in four areas: microfluidic immunoassay configurations, fluid handling modalities, multiplexed platforms, and label-free detection strategies.<br>Microfluidic immunoassay configurations<br>Microfluidic immunoassays have been implemented in both heterogeneous and homogeneous configurations. <a name='85' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#85'><font color='#FF0000'>In heterogeneous </font><i><font color='#007F00'>configurations, </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>antibodies are </font><i><font color='#007F00'>either </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>immobilized on the surface of the microfluidic device or on </font><i><font color='#007F00'>micron-dimension </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>beads </font><i><font color='#007F00'>("microbeads") embedded </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>in the device. </font></a><a name='1' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#1'><font color='#FF0000'>In homogeneous </font><i><font color='#007F00'>configurations, </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>bound and </font><i><font color='#007F00'>unbound </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>antibodies are </font></a>mostly discriminated by their electrophoretic ratio mobility in microchannels.

In response to these challenges, many covalent <a name='16' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#16'><font color='#FF0000'>and </font><i><font color='#007F00'>bioaffinity </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>immobilization </font><i><font color='#007F00'>strategies </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>have been developed </font></a>for immunoassays in microfluidic platforms.

To preserve the functionality of immobilized antibodies, sugars [23, 24], sol-gels [25] and desiccants [26] have been used to protect antibodies against denaturation. Recently, Wen et al. [27] developed <a name='61' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#61'><font color='#FF0000'>a novel antibody immobilization </font><i><font color='#007F00'>method </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>on PMMA surface </font></a>that enhanced antibody binding efficiency and capture activity.

Golden et al.

Mulvaney et al. [32, 33] developed a washing technique termed fluid force discrimination (FFD) to significantly reduce non-specific adsorption and achieved limits of detection of attomolar concentrations. In FFD assays, analytes captured on the surface are labelled with antibody-coated magnetic beads. Subsequently, non-specifically bound beads are removed by applying shear forces. The density of beads that remains bound is proportional to the analyte concentration and can be determined with either optical counting or magnetoelectronic detection of the magnetic labels. In another example, Morozov et al. [34] exploited active forces (electric, magnetic and mechanical) to achieve a zeptomole detection limit within 3 min (Fig. 1b). First, electric fields were generated to electrophoretically draw the analytes to the surface and promote capture. Second, antibody-coated magnetic beads were flowed into the channel while being attracted to the surface with a magnet, causing them to slide over the surface. Finally, the non-specifically bound beads were removed by shear forces, similar to FFD.<br>Heterogeneous microbead-based immunoassays<br><a name='79' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#79'><font color='#FF0000'>Microbeads are </font><i><font color='#007F00'>frequently </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>used in microfluidic immunoassays </font></a>as they offer a dramatic increase in surface area to volume ratio and <a name='126' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#126'><font color='#FF0000'>serve as a simple </font><i><font color='#007F00'>mechanism to </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>reproducibly </font><i><font color='#007F00'>deliver </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>antibodies </font></a>to desirable locations [4, 35]. <a name='40' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#40'><font color='#FF0000'>On the other hand, </font><i><font color='#007F00'>microbeads have </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>the </font></a>risk of adsorbing to device surfaces, clogging channels, increasing flow resistance, and scattering light [4]. <a name='159' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#159'><font color='#FF0000'>Microbeads can be </font><i><font color='#007F00'>either </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>magnetic or </font><i><font color='#007F00'>non-magnetic--this </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>often determines </font></a>the method of implementation in the microfluidic device.<br><a name='3' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#3'><font color='#FF0000'>Non-magnetic microbeads<br></font><i><font color='#007F00'>In </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>non-magnetic </font><i><font color='#007F00'>microbead-based immunoassays, a </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>physical retention </font></a>microstructure is necessary to facilitate <a name='95' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#95'><font color='#FF0000'>the removal of unbound analyte </font></a>or antibodies.

A similar strategy was successfully employed by Peoples et al. [76] to detect CRP in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid. In a very unique design, Wang et al. [77] demonstrated a nanofluidic-based electrokinetic preconcentrator in a bead-based immunoassay format (1, Fig. 1c). In this work, antibody-coated polystyrene beads were trapped by a dam structure just before the nanofluidic preconcentrator (2, Fig. 1c). <a name='50' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#50'><font color='#FF0000'>When a field is applied </font><i><font color='#007F00'>across </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>the </font></a>nanofluidic channels, an ion depletion region is created which can trap biomolecules.

Within 30 min of preconcentration, the immunoassay sensitivity was improved by 500-fold.

In this case, the full utility of the beads is not realized because the beads are localized during antibody­antigen interaction.

In this scheme, microchannels with varying cross-sections were used to retain magnetic beads (1­2, Fig. 1d).

This magnetic bead retention strategy facilitated highly efficient mixing and enhanced antibody­antigen interaction. Using this system, two immunoassay protocols <a name='86' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#86'><font color='#FF0000'>for </font><i><font color='#007F00'>the </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>detection of </font><i><font color='#007F00'>mouse </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>monoclonal antibodies </font></a>were compared. In the first protocol, capture antibody and analyte were incubated off-chip, while exposure to the detection antibody was performed on-chip. In the second protocol, the complete immunoassay was executed on-chip. The full onchip protocol was faster, consumed fewer reagents and was more sensitive compared with the off-chip incubation protocol (5­6, Fig. 1d).<br>Homogeneous capillary electrophoresis (CE)-based immunoassays<br>In homogenous configurations, bound and unbound antibodies have been discriminated by differences <a name='59' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#59'><font color='#FF0000'>in diffusion characteristics </font><i><font color='#007F00'>[2, 90], </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>isoelectric point </font></a>[91], fluorescence polarization [3, 92], fluorescence resonance energy transfer [93] and enzyme activity [94]. But the most popular form of homogeneous immunoassay is based on capillary electrophoresis (CE), in which immune complex and free antibodies are discriminated based on their electrophoretic mobilities. CE-based microfluidic chips have become very popular because of their <a name='151' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#151'><font color='#FF0000'>compatibility with </font><i><font color='#007F00'>electrokineic </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>fluid manipulation, </font><i><font color='#007F00'>rapid electrophoretic separation </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>and </font></a>enormous potential for multiplexing [4]. Harrison and co-workers [1, 95­98] pioneered the development of microfluidic CE for immunoassays. In their most elaborate design, they integrated six functional microfluidic CE manifolds on a single chip<br>and achieved simultaneous quantification of anti-estradiol and ovalbumin in less than 1 min [98]. Subsequent development from other groups focused on implementing electrochemical detection [99­101], increasing throughput [102, 103] and miniaturizing device footprint [104]. In a unique application, Kennedy and co-workers [105­108] developed high-throughput CE-based devices for longterm on-chip <a name='38' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#38'><font color='#FF0000'>monitoring </font><i><font color='#007F00'>of </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>insulin secretion from islet </font></a>of Langerhans. Notably, they developed integrated strategies to continuously perfuse fresh reagents and electrophoresis buffers to extend the operation time of their CE devices for up to 24 h [105].<br>Recently, gel-electrophoresis-based microfluidic immunoassays have gained attention because of their enhanced ability to discriminate between bound and unbound analytes [109­ 113]. In contrast to non-sieving CE microfluidic chips, <a name='106' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#106'><font color='#FF0000'>gel electrophoresis </font><i><font color='#007F00'>can separate </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>molecules based on electrophoretic mobility </font></a>and molecular weight. This is particularly important for large analytes since their charge to mass ratios are very similar to those of the corresponding immune complexes. To ensure that the immune complexes remain intact during gel electrophoresis, the sieving gels must be non-denaturing; examples of such gels include methylcellulose [111] and polyacrylamide [113]. Using different compositions of polyacrylamide gels, Herr et al. [112] developed a gel-electrophoresis-based immunoassay microchip that integrated sample pretreatment (mixing, incubation and enrichment) and electrophoresis to rapidly quantify matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) in saliva. The microchip operates on three photopatterned polyacrylamide elements: (1) a large-pore-size gel for sample loading and preparation, (2) a size-exclusion membrane for sample enrichment and mixing, and (3) a small-pore-size gel for electrophoretic <a name='120' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#120'><font color='#FF0000'>separation of bound and unbound </font></a>MMP-8 (1, Fig. 1e). First, the antibodies and analytes were electrophoretically loaded against the size-exclusion membrane for a fixed duration. Then, the sample plug was eluted off the membrane for electrophoretic separation. The enrichment process enhanced the antibody­antigen interaction by minimizing diffusion distances (2, Fig. 1e). As a result, a longer enrichment time resulted in a higher immune complex signal (3, Fig. 1e).<br>Fluid handling modalities for immunoassays in microfluidic platforms<br>Conventional immunoassays are labour-intensive as they require sophisticated fluid handling steps at various stages of the assay [114]. To miniaturize immunoassays in microfluidic systems, analogous fluidic operations have been developed which use fluid handling forces that fall under three major categories: electric, pressure and passive. Each<br>996 A.H.C. Ng et al.<br>category has several unique benefits that can be exploited to improve the performance or versatility of immunoassays.<br>Electric fluid handling<br>Electrokinetic flow<br>In microchannels, <a name='24' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#24'><font color='#FF0000'>electric forces for flow are generated by </font></a>electrophoretic and electroosmotic interactions of applied fields with ionic species in the fluid [6].

The direction of this flow can be controlled by applying appropriate voltage polarity to the channel reservoirs and/or changing the net charges on the channel surface. Consequently, electrokinetic flow does <a name='76' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#76'><font color='#FF0000'>not require valves or pumps </font></a>and is amenable for automation. The use of this fluid modality for surface-based heterogeneous immunoassays was pioneered by de Rooij and co-workers [115, 116] and further popularized by Li and co-workers [7, 117]. Recent simulations by Hu et al. [118] suggest that electrokinetically driven immunoassays <a name='42' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#42'><font color='#FF0000'>have better </font><i><font color='#007F00'>reaction </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>kinetics than pressure-driven assays </font></a>because of the uniform plug-like velocity profile afforded by electroosmosis. Although electrokinetic flow has many salient features, there are strict requirements for buffers and reagents used in the channels and materials used for device construction. For example, fluids <a name='57' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#57'><font color='#FF0000'>used in such systems must be conductive; </font></a>however, if the <a name='43' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#43'><font color='#FF0000'>ionic strength is too high, </font></a>Joule heating can undermine the performance of <a name='70' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#70'><font color='#FF0000'>the assay.

Electrophoresis is a useful phenomenon that forms the foundation of CE-based homogeneous immunoassays, in which antigen and immune complexes are discriminated by their electrophoretic mobilities. <a name='90' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#90'><font color='#FF0000'>The </font><i><font color='#007F00'>sensitivities </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>of </font><i><font color='#007F00'>CE-based immunoassays </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>can be enhanced by </font></a>a sample stacking technique termed isotachophoresis (ITP). Using this technique, Mohamadi et al. [111] developed a highly sensitive immunoassay for quantifying human serum albumin (HSA) in a gel-electrophoresisbased microfluidic device (Fig. 2a, b). In this work, a mixture of fluorescently labelled HSA and its immune complex with a monoclonal antibody was preconcentrated<br>by ITP and resolved by electrophoresis in a methylcellulose solution. ITP preconcentration was facilitated by the inclusion of high-mobility ions in the leading electrolyte (LE) and low-mobility ions in the trailing electrolyte (TE), which were respectively loaded in the buffer waste reservoir (BW) and buffer reservoir (BR) (1, Fig. 2a). The sample mixture was electrokinetically injected into the channel from the sample reservoir (SR) by applying high electric potential at sample waste reservoir (SW) (2, Fig. 2a). Subsequently, a sample plug was injected in the orthogonal separation channel by changing the potential at the reservoirs (4, Fig. 2a). During ITP stacking, the disparate electric field intensities in the TE, sample plug and LE caused the sample plug to focus in a narrow band (3­5, Fig. 2a). Concomitantly, the HSA and immune complex formed distinct bands by electrophoretic separation (6, Fig. 2a). An 800-fold signal enhancement was achieved with respect to control experiments without ITP preconcentration. Figure 2b shows fluorescent images of electrokinetic sample injection and sample preconcentration by ITP. The full process of injection, preconcentration and separation were controlled by an automated sequential voltage switching program. Subsequent work on ITP-CEbased immunoassays by Satomura and co-workers [120, 121] integrated of all assay steps on-chip by using ITP to efficiently mix antibodies and analyte in addition to preconcentration and separation.<br>Digital microfluidics<br>In an emerging paradigm of electric fluid manipulation called digital microfluidics (DMF), fluids are controlled as discrete droplets <a name='2' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#2'><font color='#FF0000'>in contrast to continuous flow in channels. </font></a>In DMF, droplets of reagents and samples are manipulated on an array of electrodes which are <a name='143' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#143'><font color='#FF0000'>insulated by a hydrophobic dielectric layer. </font></a>By applying sequences of AC or DC electric potentials between ground and actuation electrodes, droplets can be driven to move, merge, split and dispense from reservoirs by a combination of electrostatic and dielectrophoresis forces [122­124].

The full immunoassay protocol was implemented in six steps: (1) a droplet containing magnetic beads with antibodies, reporter antibodies and blocking proteins (prepared off-chip) was merged and mixed with a droplet of analyte on-chip; (2) the pooled droplet was shuttled on six sets of electrodes for 2 min to allow for antibody­antigen binding (1, Fig. 2c); (3) the reaction mixture was delivered over the magnet to immobilize the magnetic beads (2, Fig. 2c); (4) the unbound supernatant was removed by splitting the excess liquid from the beads (3, Fig. 2c); (5) unbound molecules were further washed by passing five<br>Immunoassays in microfluidic systems<br>997<br>Fig. 2 Fluid handling modalities for immunoassays in microfluidic platforms. a Schematic of electrokinetically driven preconcentration of protein sample in a gel-electrophoresis channel. b Fluorescent images of electrokinetic sample injection and sample stacking.

This paradigm relies on mechanical elastomeric valves that are formed by multilayer soft-lithography with PDMS [137]. These structures can be used to isolate reagents and samples from each other for storage or reactions. A mixing component can be formed by placing several pneumatic valves in a circular loop [114]. Also, by arranging <a name='92' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#92'><font color='#FF0000'>at least three pneumatic valves </font></a>in a row, peristaltic pumps are formed for fluid propulsion [138].

Fluid movements between microchambers are typically gated by capillary or hydrophobic valves [119, 139]. By spinning the disc with a motor, the centrifugal force overcomes the capillary or surface forces of these valves, enabling fluid to be pumped sequentially from the centre of the CD to the edge with increasing spin frequency [6].

By using microfluidics for sample delivery, faster surface reaction rates are achieved because of reduced diffusion distances within microchannels. Although microfluidic chambers allow simultaneous access to multiple spots of an array, there are some fabrication challenges that limit its use. <a name='58' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#58'><font color='#FF0000'>The </font><i><font color='#007F00'>aspect ratios </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>of the </font><i><font color='#007F00'>chambers </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>need to </font></a>be taken into consideration, especially for plastic microfluidic devices.

In this work, a microfluidic device capable of handling 10 samples simultaneously was positioned perpendicular to the patterned stripes and electrokinetic pumping was used to deliver samples to the immobilized antibody surface. Kartalov et al. [130] also used µFNs for protein patterning and immunoassays; but in this work, pneumatic valves were used to control the solutions that were introduced and also the sequence in which all the reagents were dispensed. Using this device, the authors detected <a name='35' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#35'><font color='#FF0000'>5 different </font><i><font color='#007F00'>proteins </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>from 10 samples </font></a>simultaneously.<br>µFNs have a number of advantages. First, such systems are relatively easy to implement and customize due to the availability of established microfabrication protocols. Second, the solution composition requirements are less stringent because evaporation in a closed channel is easier to control, whereas in spotting techniques, the solution is exposed to the environment. Third, the mass transfer of proteins is much faster in the microscale, allowing immobilization to occur in minutes rather than hours.<br>µFNs also have certain disadvantages. First, <a name='10' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#10'><font color='#FF0000'>the </font><i><font color='#007F00'>increased </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>surface area to volume </font></a>ratios of microfluidic channels increases the interaction of proteins with the channels, leading to non-specific adsorption of proteins. This is usually overcome by passivating the microchannels and/or by ensuring a continuous flow of reagents through the microchannel [5]. Second, protein spotters can produce spots of proteins with higher densities as compared to the strips patterned by the microchannels. Third, protein spotters can process multiple slides in a single run, while the µFN-based patterning method is limited by the number of µFNs available.<br>DNA-directed immobilization for antibody microarrays<br>Another method used to pattern antibodies for microfluidic immunoassays is a DNA-directed approach known as DNA encoded antibody library (DEAL). In this approach, antibodies are attached (or encoded) with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with complementary sequence to a second strand that is immobilized on a DNA microarray. When <a name='153' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#153'><font color='#FF0000'>the </font><i><font color='#007F00'>DNAlabelled </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>antibody is </font><i><font color='#007F00'>introduced to </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>the </font><i><font color='#007F00'>array, </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>the </font></a>complementary DNA strands bind to each other, leading to the immobilization of antibodies at a specific location on the array. Bailey et al. [18] used this method to detect multiple proteins in a microfluidic channel. In this approach, PDMS channels were positioned over a DNA array and the microfluidic channels were used to introduce solutions required for the immunoassay. DNA-directed immobilization is particularly advantageous for microfluidic-based systems because DNA is a more robust molecule than antibodies, allowing for the use of harsh conditions required for certain fabrication steps such as the assembly<br>and proper sealing of a channel on a solid substrate. In addition, there are no problems associated with allowing the DNA spots to dry, while antibodies can lose their structure and function if dehydrated. One cause for concern is the potential effect of the ssDNA on antibody function. The authors report that up to 3 DNA strands per antibody has minimal effect on antibody function.<br>Another unique experiment demonstrated by Bailey et al. <a name='115' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#115'><font color='#FF0000'>was </font><i><font color='#007F00'>the ability </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>to perform a </font><i><font color='#007F00'>homogeneous </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>immunoassay </font></a>in solution, and then immobilize <a name='113' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#113'><font color='#FF0000'>the </font><i><font color='#007F00'>entire immune complex </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>on the surface </font><i><font color='#007F00'>using </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>the </font></a>specific DNA strands.

For a general review on the integration of microbeads with microfluidic technologies, we suggest Derveaux et al. [162]. This section focuses on the use of beads for multiplexed immunoassays in microfluidic platforms.<br>The principle for bead-based multiplexing is to encode the beads such <a name='67' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#67'><font color='#FF0000'>that the identity of the antibody </font></a>immobilized can be determined <a name='34' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#34'><font color='#FF0000'>by </font><i><font color='#007F00'>decoding </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>the </font><i><font color='#007F00'>signal </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>from the beads.

Other methods for encoding beads include optical, electronic, physical and graphical; these schemes are reviewed by Braeckmans et al. [164] and are not discussed in detail here. The most common method employed for multiplexed immunoassays in microfluidic platforms is fluorescence encoding (optical).

The microfluidic device had a unique structure in which the beads were trapped in a chamber within a channel loop, allowing the continuous flow of sample using only the initial plug introduced in the loop, which helped improve reaction kinetics while using a small volume.<br>Quantum dots (fluorescent nanoparticles) have also been used for labelling microbeads in both the one-dimensional [165] and two-dimensional (2D) labelling schemes [167]. Quantum dots are especially advantageous for the 2D labelling scheme because of their narrow emission peaks and their broad, size-independent absorption spectrum, allowing all colours to be excited by using a single light source. Han et al. [167] demonstrated the 2D labelling scheme using quantum dots and claim that this method has potential for an encoding scheme with 10,000­40,000 unique codes (using 5­6 different colours at six intensity levels).

In contrast to previous approaches in which an imaging method was used for the bead readout, Klostranec et al. used an approach similar to a flow cytometer, using the effect of hydrodynamic focusing in microchannels <a name='46' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#46'><font color='#FF0000'>to focus the </font><i><font color='#007F00'>beads </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>into a </font><i><font color='#007F00'>single </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>stream </font></a>such that they could be<br>analyzed in series.

Some of the label-free sensing technologies also facilitate real-time measurements allowing for kinetics quantitation. In this section we briefly discuss some of the label-free methods used for microfluidic-based multiplexed immunoassays. For a more detailed discussion on this topic, see Qavi et al. [171].<br>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based detection<br>Surface plasmon resonance is one of the most widely used label-free detection schemes in microfluidic platforms. In this method, light is used to excite surface plasmons in a thin film of metal, which occurs as a function of wavelength and angle of incidence. The surface plasmons have an evanescent character, making the technique highly sensitive to refractive index changes at the metal­liquid<br>Immunoassays in microfluidic systems<br>1003<br>interface, such as when an antigen binds to an immobilized antibody. There are a number of techniques that make use of SPR for multiplexed measurements. One of these is surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi), in which light at a fixed wavelength and angle of incidence is shined on a thin metal film, and the reflected light is recorded by a CCD camera. Binding events <a name='114' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#114'><font color='#FF0000'>on the surface </font><i><font color='#007F00'>cause </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>a </font><i><font color='#007F00'>local change in </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>the </font></a>refractive index, changing the surface plasmons at a specific spot on the surface. For a welloptimized system, a lateral resolution of 2 µm is possible [172]. Kanda <a name='155' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#155'><font color='#FF0000'>et al. </font><i><font color='#007F00'>[173] </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>developed microfluidic </font><i><font color='#007F00'>networks </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>for </font></a>patterning a gold surface and detected the binding of anti-bovine IgG to bovine IgG patterned on the surface. In another example, Luo et al. [133] demonstrated the use of a pneumatic valve microfluidic device to pattern an array of gold patches with antibodies and also to perform surface binding experiments over a 96-component array on the same chip. Krishnamoorthy et al. [174] also used SPRi to detect surface binding events in a microchip that used electrokinetic flow focusing to selectively deliver samples over a single row of an array. The high lateral resolution and surface sensitivity of this method make it a good fit for surface microarrays in microfluidic chips.<br>Extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) is another detection scheme that uses the phenomenon of plasmon resonance. To perform an EOT experiment, light is shined on an array of subwavelength holes (nanohole array) in a thin metallic film and the transmitted light is monitored (Fig. 4a). The intensity of light transmitting through the apertures is low for such structures, but the coupling of light with the surface plasmons allows certain wavelengths to pass through the nanohole array at intensities much greater than predicted. The dependence of this phenomenon on plasmon resonance makes the wavelength of light transmitted sensitive to binding events on the surface. The use of these sensors for immunoassays <a name='14' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#14'><font color='#FF0000'>has been </font><i><font color='#007F00'>demonstrated </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>by </font><i><font color='#007F00'>Sharpe </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>et al. </font></a>[175] and the integration of this sensing technique on microfluidic chips <a name='17' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#17'><font color='#FF0000'>has been </font><i><font color='#007F00'>demonstrated </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>by </font><i><font color='#007F00'>De Leebeeck </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>et al. </font></a>[176]. In these cases, white light was incident on the nanohole arrays and the transmission spectrum was collected to monitor the binding event, but this configuration would not be useful for multiplexed measurements. Ji et al. [177] demonstrated the use of nanohole arrays in imaging mode with a fixed wavelength, with the transmitted intensity being monitored by using a CCD camera. Using this method the authors were able to monitor 25 nanohole arrays simultaneously. The use of EOT is particularly advantageous for microfluidic systems because of their small footprint and also because of their transmission mode of operation. The transmission mode of operation allows the adaptation of microscopes to be used for performing SPR measurements, as opposed to the requirement of a dedicated SPR sensing system.<br>Fig. 4 Label-free detection schemes for multiplexed immunoassays in microfluidic platforms. a Extraordinary optical transmission of light though nanohole arrays on metal films as a detection scheme for surface-based assays.

(Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Nature Biotechnology [178], © 2005)<br>Silicon nanowire field effect transistors<br>Another label-free technique that has been combined with microfluidics is a silicon nanowire (SiNW) field effect transistor. Field effect transistors comprise a semiconductor connected to source, drain and gate electrodes; the last of these controls the conductance of the detector. SiNWs behave as semiconductors and have been used as field effect transistor immunosensors in which the gate electrode is replaced by a layer of capture antibodies. The dielectric environment of the silicon nanowire changes as a function of antibody binding, resulting in a change in the conductance of the detector (Fig. 4b). Zheng et al.

In imaging ellipsometry, elliptically polarized light is shined on a reflective surface (which may contain layers of adsorbed molecules), and the reflected ray (now linearly polarized because of the reflection of light by the surface features) is analyzed to determine the thickness of the adsorbed layers. By using a spatially sensitive detector such as a CCD camera, an image of the surface can be obtained and can be used to monitor surface binding events. Wang et al. [179, 180] used imaging ellipsometry coupled to a microfluidic device to detect five different markers of hepatitis B. This is a very sensitive technique, capable of monitoring small surface thicknesses, and is also known to have a spatial sensitivity in the micrometer regime.<br>The above-mentioned methods are only a small subset of available label-free detection technologies. There are many other label-free detection methods that have not yet been implemented in an array format for microfluidics, including interferometry [181], wavelength interrogated optical sensing [182], liquid crystals [183] and microcantilevers [184]. We propose that these techniques and others may have promise for multiplexed immunoassays in microfluidics in the future.<br>plexing represents the latest and most exciting development in microfluidic immunoassays, and observed that while surface microarrays and microbeads can both be used for this purpose, microbeads are more practical because of <a name='41' href='On-Chip Immunoassay for Molecular Analysis.txt.Immunoassays in microfluidic systems.txt.html#41'><font color='#FF0000'>the </font><i><font color='#007F00'>flexibility this system offers. </font></i><font color='#FF0000'>On the other hand, </font></a>we noted that microarrays are suited for high-density multiplexed analysis and that this format is compatible with label-free detection schemes.<br>In the final analysis, we see great potential for growth in microfluidic immunoassays, which leads us to make several predictions. The current techniques for enhancing antigen­ antibody interaction will continue to improve and will eventually be adapted for multiplexed immunoassays. Fluid handling techniques will become more versatile as multiple modes will be integrated onto a given platform. Multiplexed immunoassays coupled with label-free detection strategies will eventually lead to devices capable of realtime multi-analyte quantification. Surface immobilization strategies will continue to improve, with the aim of achieving an ideal surface that offers high antibody activity and low non-specific binding. These developments will increase the functionality, sensitivity and throughput of microfluidic immunoassays to accelerate progress in fields such as proteomics and drug screening. As devices become smaller, they will become more compatible with point of care (POC) applications, which has the potential to revolutionize the way medical care is delivered, particularly in resource-poor areas. The main challenge that remains for microfluidic immunoassays is to reduce device complexity, making systems more robust, cost-effective and userfriendly.
